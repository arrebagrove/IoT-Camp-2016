# Getting to know Gadgeteer
![](http://www.ghielectronics.com/img/www/products/541-1_large.jpg)

Gadgeteer started as part of Microsoft Research as a way to easily connect modules and program them using the .NET Micro Framework. Since then, we've been working to make it part of the Windows 10 IoT Core ecosystem as well. The Gadgeteer experience for Windows 10 doesn't currently include the Visual Studio designer support, but the libraries and modules are there.

In the room for the hack, you'll find a number of Gadgeteer HATs and modules for use with the Raspberry Pi 3 and Windows 10 IoT Core. For developers new to electronics, Gadgeteer is a way to access modules without worrying about letting out the magic smoke. :)
